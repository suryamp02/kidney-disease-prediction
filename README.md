Naive bayes Algoritm
 Chronic Kidney Disease prediction has been discussed in this project. 
 Naive bayes algorithm is used in this project to prediction.
 Chronic Kidney Disease dataset has been taken from the UCI repository.
 using the naive bayes algorithm the result obtained is 99 accuracy.
 it is also compare with other machine learning algorithms such as Knn,Lsvm, Logistic Legression, Artificial Neural Network,but result shows that naive bayes algorithm still have the best accuracy.
 Front end is developed using HTML,CSS.
 Back end is Python.
